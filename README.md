# Incident Response Handler’s Journal

This repository contains documented security investigations conducted as part of my cybersecurity training and lab environments.  

The purpose of this journal is to demonstrate structured incident handling, analytical reasoning, and technical investigation skills aligned with the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle.

---

## Investigation Methodology

All cases are documented following structured incident response principles:

- Detection & Analysis  
- Impact Assessment  
- Containment Considerations  
- Eradication & Recovery (when applicable)  
- Lessons Learned  

The focus is on demonstrating investigative thinking, evidence evaluation, and response decision-making.
